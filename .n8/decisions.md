# Decision log

Append-only. One `##` section per skill run, entries in chronological order. Record real decisions (choices between alternatives, assumptions, deviations from plan), not routine actions.

```markdown
## /n8-exec M1 — YYYY-MM-DD

- **Decision:** <what was chosen>
  **Why:** <reasoning; cost if wrong>
  **Issue:** #N
```

## Ad-hoc entries (the drift ledger)

Changes made outside the n8SDLC commands that deviate from what planned issues assume get an `## Ad-hoc` section. `/n8-replan`, `/n8-exec`'s preflight, and `/n8-stat` read these to detect stale plans. When `/n8-replan` processes an entry it appends `— reconciled by /n8-replan <date>`.

```markdown
## Ad-hoc — YYYY-MM-DD

- **Change:** <what changed, e.g. auth provider switched from Google to Okta>
  **Why:** <reason>
  **Affects:** <milestones/issues whose plans may now be stale>
```

## /n8-init — 2026-10-07

- **Decision:** Renamed the default branch from `master` to `main` before the first commit.
  **Why:** n8SDLC conventions and the `main` ruleset assume `main`; free to change with no history.
- **Decision:** Python tooling is uv + ruff + mypy (strict) + pytest, Python ≥3.12 (dev pinned to 3.14).
  **Why:** Matches the Engine repo's toolchain (docs/02 in nathanpond/Epistrel specifies Python 3.12+ with mypy). Django typing via django-stubs, tests via pytest-django.
- **Decision:** Security findings are logged as public `security` issues.
  **Why:** Same policy as the Engine: open-source, self-hosted, no production deployment to protect.
- **Decision:** Moved `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to environment variables before the first public push.
  **Why:** `startproject` hardcodes a secret key; publishing it would make it a known value. A dev-only fallback key is accepted only while DEBUG is on.

## /n8-roadmap — 2026-10-07

- **Decision:** Milestones M0–M10 mirror the Engine's one-for-one; each Console M<n> depends on Engine M<n> being verified. 26 epics, one per Engine capability that gets a Console surface, each naming the Engine epics it mirrors.
  **Why:** The Console's purpose is to see and debug the Engine working; its roadmap has no independent shape.
- **Decision:** Single-operator dev tool with Django auth; the logged-in user is the requesting principal. Play view and inspector panels side by side.
- **Decision:** Django templates + HTMX, no JS build step. Console DB holds only its own concerns.
- **Decision:** No accessibility work and no 508 audit.
  **Why:** User's call for a single-operator dev tool.
- **Decision:** No project invariants.
  **Why:** User judged the CI and maintenance cost unjustified for a dev console; CLAUDE.md guidance (REST-only, env secrets) covers the one rule that matters, and `/n8-audit` still checks it.
- **Decision:** Deployment = compose alongside the Engine `edge` image with Postgres; SQLite for dev; `v*` tags publish image + release. Nothing hosted.
- **Decision:** CI tests use a fake Engine built from the Engine's OpenAPI schema, plus one live smoke job against the Engine `edge` service container.
  **Why:** Catches API drift in the Console's own CI without making every test depend on a running Engine.
- **Decision:** M9 "Bug fixes & testing" left unplanned; M10 Audit.
