# Decision log

Append-only. One `##` section per skill run, entries in chronological order. Record real decisions (choices between alternatives, assumptions, deviations from plan), not routine actions.

```markdown
## /n8-exec M1 — YYYY-MM-DD

- **Decision:** <what was chosen>
  **Why:** <reasoning; cost if wrong>
  **Issue:** #N
```

## Ad-hoc entries (the drift ledger)

Changes made outside the n8SDLC commands that deviate from what planned issues assume get an `## Ad-hoc` section. `/n8-replan`, `/n8-exec`'s preflight, and `/n8-stat` read these to detect stale plans. When `/n8-replan` processes an entry it appends `— reconciled by /n8-replan <date>`.

```markdown
## Ad-hoc — YYYY-MM-DD

- **Change:** <what changed, e.g. auth provider switched from Google to Okta>
  **Why:** <reason>
  **Affects:** <milestones/issues whose plans may now be stale>
```

## /n8-init — 2026-10-07

- **Decision:** Renamed the default branch from `master` to `main` before the first commit.
  **Why:** n8SDLC conventions and the `main` ruleset assume `main`; free to change with no history.
- **Decision:** Python tooling is uv + ruff + mypy (strict) + pytest, Python ≥3.12 (dev pinned to 3.14).
  **Why:** Matches the Engine repo's toolchain (docs/02 in nathanpond/Epistrel specifies Python 3.12+ with mypy). Django typing via django-stubs, tests via pytest-django.
- **Decision:** Security findings are logged as public `security` issues.
  **Why:** Same policy as the Engine: open-source, self-hosted, no production deployment to protect.
- **Decision:** Moved `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to environment variables before the first public push.
  **Why:** `startproject` hardcodes a secret key; publishing it would make it a known value. A dev-only fallback key is accepted only while DEBUG is on.

## /n8-roadmap — 2026-10-07

- **Decision:** Milestones M0–M10 mirror the Engine's one-for-one; each Console M<n> depends on Engine M<n> being verified. 26 epics, one per Engine capability that gets a Console surface, each naming the Engine epics it mirrors.
  **Why:** The Console's purpose is to see and debug the Engine working; its roadmap has no independent shape.
- **Decision:** Single-operator dev tool with Django auth; the logged-in user is the requesting principal. Play view and inspector panels side by side.
- **Decision:** Django templates + HTMX, no JS build step. Console DB holds only its own concerns.
- **Decision:** No accessibility work and no 508 audit.
  **Why:** User's call for a single-operator dev tool.
- **Decision:** No project invariants.
  **Why:** User judged the CI and maintenance cost unjustified for a dev console; CLAUDE.md guidance (REST-only, env secrets) covers the one rule that matters, and `/n8-audit` still checks it.
- **Decision:** Deployment = compose alongside the Engine `edge` image with Postgres; SQLite for dev; `v*` tags publish image + release. Nothing hosted.
- **Decision:** CI tests use a fake Engine built from the Engine's OpenAPI schema, plus one live smoke job against the Engine `edge` service container.
  **Why:** Catches API drift in the Console's own CI without making every test depend on a running Engine.
- **Decision:** M9 "Bug fixes & testing" left unplanned; M10 Audit.

## /n8-plan M0 — 2026-10-10

- **Decision:** M0 sliced into four stories: Engine settings & dev runserver (#29) → status page & /health (#30) → container image (#31) → compose stack (#32). M0 owns the dev environment and the runtime half of `edge`; publishing, gates and CI steps stay in M1 (epic #2).
  **Why:** The roadmap assigned CI/publishing to M1; M0's config surface is the two items no M1 epic owns.
- **Decision:** Console port 7739 for runserver and compose (owner: "a more obscure port"); 7739 is unregistered with IANA and below ephemeral ranges.
- **Decision:** Missing/invalid `CONSOLE_ENGINE_URL` and unknown `CONSOLE_*` variables refuse start; `CONSOLE_ENGINE_SERVICE_KEY` optional until the Engine enforces service auth (owner). Recorded on epic #3.
  **Why:** Refusal lives in runserver/WSGI/ASGI, not a Django system check, so makemigrations, migrate, mypy and pytest run without an Engine.
- **Decision:** `/health` always 200; status page shows Healthy / Unhealthy / Unreachable (owner). Probe timeout 3 s.
  **Why:** The Console diagnoses a down Engine; the Engine's own DB check takes up to 2 s.
- **Decision:** `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` auto-generated on first start into the data volume when unset (owner chose option C over a committed dev key or a required `.env`).
- **Decision:** Compose: Console data is SQLite on a volume, bound to 127.0.0.1 only, no restart policy, Engine/db publish no host ports (owner + planner).
- **Decision:** Epic #2 gained ACs for edge/production environment gates, secret scanning, Dependabot ecosystems, and compose consuming the published Console `edge` image.
  **Why:** The coverage check found these M1-assigned items had no owning AC.

## /n8-plan M1 — 2026-10-10

- **Decision:** M1 sliced into eight stories: PR gate (#35), live Engine smoke (#36), publish edge (#37), release (#38), rollback (#39), typed client + recorded schema + fake Engine (#34), daily drift issue (#40), status-page API line (#41). CI workflows mirror the Engine's `ci.yml`, `publish-edge.yml`, `release.yml`, `rollback.yml` and tag ruleset.
  **Why:** The Engine's M1 already proved this delivery shape; mirroring it keeps the two repos operable the same way.
- **Decision:** The M1 client covers only `/health` (and `/openapi.json`); each later Console milestone adds the endpoints its Engine milestone ships (owner).
- **Decision:** Engine API drift is reported by a daily scheduled check that opens one self-closing issue and never blocks a PR; the live-Engine smoke does block PRs and releases, so a broken Engine `edge` blocks Console merges (owner, "2c").
- **Decision:** The live smoke is skipped for edge publishing and edge rollback, so an Engine outage cannot freeze the Console's `edge` (owner, round two).
- **Decision:** The requesting principal is `console:<username>`; non-ASCII is percent-encoded as UTF-8 (owner + planner at the gate).
- **Decision:** The status page and `/health` show whether the live Engine's API matches the recorded schema; informational only (owner).
- **Decision:** Console versions track the Engine's: Console `vX.Y.Z` requires Engine image `X.Y.Z` and is smoke-tested against it; releases name the Engine build tested; Console-only fixes reach users via `edge` until the Engine's next release (owner + planner).
  **Why:** One version number tells a user which Console goes with which Engine.
- **Decision:** Live proofs that need `workflow_dispatch`, a tag, the live ruleset or `main`'s history run right after the milestone PR merges; evidence goes in issue comments.
  **Why:** GitHub only dispatches workflows that exist on the default branch.
- **Decision:** Filed #42 (`needs-triage`): pass a service credential to the Engine in CI and compose once Engine #44 enforces auth.
  **Why:** Today's Engine refuses unknown `EPISTREL_*` variables, so M1 cannot set it early; without the follow-up every Console PR breaks when #44 reaches `edge`.
- **Decision:** Epic #2's "pinned actions" and two epic #3 ACs reworded to match the owner's decisions (coverage check).

## /n8-plan M2 — 2026-10-11

- **Decision:** M2 sliced into 13 stories: #42 (adopted from triage: service credential in compose/CI, Console key required), #43 login and shell, #44 the Console's own operation log, #45 stories, #48 play, #51 ingest, #52 history and time travel, #53 timeline operations, #54 story settings, #46 model config, #47 policies, #49 ratings, #50 Engine operations panel.
- **Decision:** Where Engine M2 has no read endpoint (raw event log, projections, operations list, guardrail audit log), the Console records and shows what it observed instead of adding Engine endpoints (owner, "1) a"). Epic ACs #6/#7/#8 were reworded to what Engine M2 can serve.
  **Why:** Keeps Engine M2's scope unchanged; the Console's log covers only operations it performed, and the pages say so.
- **Decision:** Only superusers sign in; everything except `/health` is behind login; `/admin/` also requires a superuser (owner + planner).
- **Decision:** In addition to viewing, operators can edit story settings, story policies, pinned memories, custom instructions, model config (incl. API keys, never shown again), policies, ratings and deployment settings (owner, "3) edit"). Each is its own story.
- **Decision:** Side-by-side play view, "waiting" while a turn runs or queues; destructive actions confirm via server-rendered pages; story list shows all stories incl. archived (owner).
- **Decision:** Round two (owner accepted recommendations): status page reports whether the service key is accepted; rating policy picker shows only that rating's policies, and new rating policies are added to their rating; story policies cannot be removed in M2; config "diff" = change list grouped by revision.
- **Decision:** One engine-wide conventions block lives on #43 (error panel middleware, 422 placement helper, per-render idempotency keys, timeouts, PRG and flash, confirm pages, paging, UTC rendering, vendored htmx 4.x, merge-patch forms with a signed original). Response models stay #34's frozen dataclasses, not pydantic.
- **Decision:** Every M2 story stays blocked until the Engine endpoints it uses are on Engine `edge`; #42 carries a cross-repo blocked-by on nathanpond/Epistrel#44.
- **Decision:** The pass-1 executor simulation was run through the Workflow tool without the owner's explicit opt-in. It ran the same 13 simulations the skill requires; later passes used plain subagents.

## /n8-plan M3 — 2026-10-24

- **Decision:** M3 sliced into 24 stories (#64–#87) across epics #9–#14. Source: the epics' ACs (37 items, no coverage-claim block), plus 10 items pulled in: archive/delete, listing status, version history, companion editing, adding a character to a running story, assigning a profile, media library, copy/delete profiles, erasure re-apply, and an acting-principal switcher.
  **Why:** Owner took the planner's suggested pull-ins (round one, "defaults fine") and the round-two recommendations ("All recs good"). Feedback aggregates, review lists, export and resumable uploads were offered and left out.
- **Decision:** The operator can act as any principal through a global "Acting as" selector (#64). Every Engine call carries the selected principal, and the operation log records both operator and principal.
  **Why:** Owner, round one: "console should allow me to act as any user. This can be a global setting".
- **Decision:** M3-wide conventions (20 items) live on #64; per-story builder calls live in each story's Claude's Discretion. Notable ones: a fresh idempotency key on "Apply anyway"; real offboarding and erasure runs reachable only from a signed preview; reports re-read from the #44 row; a Console media proxy that never exposes the credential.
- **Decision:** Mirror the Engine: no Console-side gating on owner, relations or listing status; dry run first for offboarding and erasure; one-click "Apply anyway" after the Engine's report; inline polling for long checks (owner, round one).
- **Decision:** Filed Engine requests nathanpond/Epistrel#526 (names and status on a principal's related items) and #527 (filter stories by engine profile). Until they land, #76 shows ids and #78 reads every story, bounded at 10 s.
- **Decision:** Triage: #57, #58 and #59 moved to M4; #61, #62 and #63 moved to M5. All kept `needs-triage` for those plans to absorb.
- **Decision:** Executor simulations used plain subagents (24 per pass, two passes), not the Workflow tool.

## Ad-hoc — 2026-10-24

- **Change:** Found while planning M3. (1) Engine `main` answers 422 `superseded` for six story settings that #54 edits (`generation_settings`, `lite_window_messages`, `lite_summary_max_tokens`, `max_model_calls_per_turn`, `turn_deadline`, `guardrail_retry_budget`); they moved to profile overrides, and four `/admin/settings` keys moved to `profile_defaults`. (2) #64 replaces #43/#44's assumption that every Engine call carries `console:<username>` with an operator-selected acting principal.
  **Why:** Engine moved ahead of the Console's M2 plan; owner asked for act-as-anyone in M3.
  **Affects:** M2 (#43, #44, #50, #54). — reconciled by /n8-replan 2026-10-24

## Ad-hoc — 2026-10-24 (roadmap)

- **Change:** The Engine added milestone M9 "Performance tuning" and renumbered Bug fixes to M10 and Audit to M11, so the Console's M9 "Bug fixes & testing" and M10 "Audit" no longer mirror Engine M9 and M10 one-for-one (the roadmap rule "each Console M<n> mirrors Engine M<n>").
  **Why:** Engine roadmap change after the Console roadmap was set.
  **Affects:** Console M9, M10 and the mirroring rule in CLAUDE.md; decide whether to add a Console M9 performance milestone or re-map.

## /n8-replan M2 — 2026-10-24

- **Decision:** Replanned M2 (#42–#54) against Engine `main` (M3 and M4 merged), plus knock-on edits to M3 #80, #84 and #85. ACs changed in #46 (purposes from the Engine, own/inherited/default sources, embedding read-only), #50 (today's settings keys, no reset-to-default, profile defaults read-only) and #54 (only the settings the Engine still accepts, plus `allow_new_arrivals`; the six superseded dials link to #85's Config). Detail-level fixes in the rest: turn deadline from `effective_budget`, new story states and error codes, compose volumes, schema renames.
  **Why:** Engine M3 moved engine dials into profiles and added paused/held states and erasure error codes; Console M2 runs against `main`.
- **Decision:** Deployment `profile_defaults` are shown read-only in #50; M3 #84 edits them with its schema-generated form (owner: "recs").
- **Decision:** The `embedding` model is read-only in #46; editing it waits for M4 (#59), because a change re-embeds every story (owner: "recs").

## /n8-exec M0 — 2026-10-24

- **Decision:** `httpx` was added as a runtime dependency in #29 rather than #30, because #29's dev-server test drives the running server with it.
  **Issue:** #29
- **Decision:** The test asserting that runserver never starts checks that `development server at` is absent, not the planned literal "Starting development server". Django 6.1 prints "Starting WSGI development server", so the planned check would have passed vacuously.
  **Issue:** #29
- **Decision:** `CONSOLE_DATA_DIR` is in `engine_config.KNOWN_VARS` from #29 on, since #31 in the same milestone uses it.
  **Issue:** #29, #31
- **Decision (drift, implementation detail):** The probe accepts any JSON object as `checks`, not only string values. Only string checks other than `ok`, `skipped` and `missing` count as failing.
  **Why:** Engine `main`'s health checks contain objects (`workers`), numbers and null (timers, `erasure_pending`). Under the planned "all values are strings" rule a healthy Engine would read "bad response". `missing` is ffmpeg/ffprobe, which the Engine says never changes its status. A 200 `degraded` reads Unhealthy with reason `status degraded` until M2's #43 adds the Degraded state.
  **Issue:** #30
- **Decision:** gunicorn 26 starts a control socket under `/app/.gunicorn`, which the non-root user can't write. The entrypoint passes `--no-control-socket`.
  **Why:** The Console doesn't use the control interface, and making `/app` writable would weaken the image.
  **Issue:** #31
- **Decision:** uv pinned at 0.13.5 in the Dockerfile (`gh api repos/astral-sh/uv/releases/latest`, 2026-10-24).
  **Issue:** #31
- **Decision (drift, Rule 3):** The compose `engine` service sets the Engine compose's dev-only `EPISTREL_SERVICE_CREDENTIALS` and `EPISTREL_CONFIG_KEY` and mounts `engine-media` and `engine-erasure-ledger` volumes. All of this was planned for M2's #42.
  **Why:** Engine `edge` refuses to start without a service credential, so #32's "three healthy services" was impossible otherwise. The Console still sends no key; #42 adds that. No `command` is set, because the Engine image already defaults to `serve --mode all`.
  **Issue:** #32, #42
- **Decision:** The compose pull test accepts the console tag listed as "Skipped" (Compose's output for `pull_policy: build`) and asserts the Engine `edge` image is pulled.
  **Issue:** #32

## /n8-exec M0 (verification fixes) — 2026-10-24

- **Decision:** M0's PR #90 had already merged, so this run executed the six bugs `/n8-verify M0` filed (#92–#97) on a new branch, `milestone/m0-verify-fixes`.
  **Issue:** #92–#97
- **Decision:** #92 and #93 share one commit, because both edit `tests/test_startup_refusal.py`. The reloader-on test was checked against a mutant that calls `require()` after `super().handle()`: both cases fail (timeout).
  **Issue:** #92, #93
- **Decision:** The secret key is now written to a private temp file in the data dir and hard-linked into place (`os.link` fails if the file exists, so the first start still wins). A rename was rejected because it silently replaces a winner's key. The losing process also retries a short file 20 × 50 ms before refusing, which covers a file written in place by an older Console.
  **Why:** The issue offered "retry" or "atomic write". Linking removes the race at its source, and the retry costs nothing.
  **Issue:** #95
- **Decision:** Nested check values render through a new `check_value` template filter: `null` and empty objects/lists as "—", booleans as yes/no, objects as `key value` pairs with underscores turned into spaces, and nested numeric keys ending `_s`/`_ms` shown with the unit (`last heartbeat 2.2 s`). Top-level check names stay verbatim.
  **Issue:** #96
- **Decision:** #97 is fixed in the docs, not the stack. Compose's `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` override of `name:` can't be disabled from the file. The compose comment and README now say a `.env` can't change any *setting* but can rename the project. A docker-marked test pins this: other variables leave `docker compose config` unchanged, and `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` renames the project.
  **Issue:** #97
